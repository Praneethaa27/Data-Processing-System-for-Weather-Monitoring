Objective: Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/). 

Data Source: 
The system will continuously retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to sign up for a free API key to access the data. The API provides various weather parameters, and for this assignment, we will focus on: 
•	main: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear) 
•	temp: Current temperature in Centigrade 
•	feels_like: Perceived temperature in Centigrade 
•	dt: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp) 
Processing and Analysis: 
•	The system should continuously call the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for the metros in India. (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad) 
•	For each received weather update: 
o	Convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (tip : you can also use user preference). 
Rollups and Aggregates:
1.	Daily Weather Summary:
o	Roll up the weather data for each day. 
o	Calculate daily aggregates for:
	Average temperature 
	Maximum temperature 
	Minimum temperature 
	Dominant weather condition (give reason on this) 
o	Store the daily summaries in a database or persistent storage for further analysis. 
2.	Alerting Thresholds: 

o	Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature or specific weather conditions (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius for two consecutive updates). 
o	Continuously track the latest weather data and compare it with the thresholds. 
o	If a threshold is breached, trigger an alert for the current weather conditions. Alerts could be displayed on the console or sent through an email notification system (implementation details left open-ended). 
3.	Implement visualizations: 
o	To display daily weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts. 
Test Cases: 
1.	 System Setup: 
o	Verify system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key. 
2.	Data Retrieval: 
o	Simulate API calls at configurable intervals. 
o	Ensure the system retrieves weather data for the specified location and parses the response correctly. 
3.	Temperature Conversion: 
o	Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit) based on user preference. 
4.	Daily Weather Summary: 
o	Simulate a sequence of weather updates for several days.
o	Verify that daily summaries are calculated correctly, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures,and dominant weather condition. 
5.	Alerting Thresholds:
o	Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions.
o	Simulate weather data exceeding or breaching the thresholds. 
o	Verify that alerts are triggered only when a threshold is violated. 

Bonus: 
•	Extend the system to support additional weather parameters from the OpenWeatherMap API (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and incorporate them into rollups/aggregates. 
•	Explore functionalities like weather forecasts retrieval and generating summaries based on predicted conditions.

Tools & Technologies

•	Language: Python
•	Database: SQLite or CSV files (for lightweight persistence)
•	API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API
•	Visualization: Matplotlib or Plotly
•	Alerting: Email (optional) or console notifications
•	Test Framework: Python’s built-in unittest

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Create requirements.txt for Dependencies
First, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. This will make it easy for others to install necessary packages.
You can install these dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Create config.py for Configurations
This file will store API keys, city names, and other configurations.
Step 3: Create data_processing.py for Data Handling
This file will handle retrieving weather data, converting temperatures, and calculating aggregates.
Step 4: Create alert_system.py for Alerts
This module monitors the data and triggers alerts based on user-defined thresholds.
Step 5: Create visualization.py for Data Visualization
This file creates visualizations like daily temperature trends and alert history.
Step 6: Create app.py to Run the Main Application
This is the main file that orchestrates the API calls, data processing, and alerting.
Step 7: Create test_cases.py for Unit Tests
This file will test different functionalities of the system.
Run tests using:
python test_cases.py
How to Run the System
1.	Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
2.	Set up the API key in “config.py.”
3.	Run the main application:
python app.py
4.	Run tests:
python test_cases.py
5.	Visualize the data by running:
python visualization.py
By following these steps, you'll have a fully functioning real-time weather monitoring system complete with API integration, data rollups, alerts, and visualizations.
